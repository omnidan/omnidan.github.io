<h2>Contact me</h2>
<p>
If you want to contact me, the best way to do so is writing me an email. I read my mails daily, unlike various social networks I might be registered on. I usually do not check social networks, so please write me an email.
</p><p>
My email address is daniel(dot)bugl(at)touchlay(dot)com. Feel free to send me feedback, questions, recommendations, or anything else related to my projects.

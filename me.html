<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I'm Daniel Bugl, but some might know me as omnidan, which is my most frequently used nickname, or Daniel0108, which is my old and obsolete nickname. I currently work full-time as a student and part-time as an architect for technical structures and software engineer at TouchLay. Well, it's pretty much choose-your-time-to-work-but-follow-deadlines-and-go-to-meetings.
</p><p>
I'm interested and active in many sciences. My favourite sections are all parts of Physics (especially Electronics), Computer Science (of course), Microbiology, Mathematics (especially algorithms, logic and statistics), Psychology (especially lucid dreaming), Philosophy (especially universe theories), Sociology and probably many more. Okay, I said favourite, but in reality all kinds of science are my favourite and I'm interested in many things in general.
</p><p>
Oh, I forgot one very important science: Music. I listen to music whenever I can, but my taste might be a bit alien to you (or not?). I usually listen to Ambient, including Electronic Ambient and Experimental Ambient (Aphex Twin, yay), Psychedelic, including all sorts of psychedelic music, but especially Psybient. Besides various ambient and psychedelic styles, I also listen to orchestral, dnb, metal and chiptune / demoscene music, which I also enjoy a lot. I also like to experiment with the effect of sounds on the brain (binaural beats, for example).
</p><p>
Generally, I am a very quiet and calm person, which my musicial taste may show. I like to work with chips and play with tunes in my leisure time. I usually don't watch TV or movies, they just don't interest me. I prefer to read sci-fi books and short-stories, especially dystopian ones. Besides all that, I love to debate about various things and use IRC or go to meetups to do so.

<h2>Support me</h2>
<p>
First of all, you can fork my repositories on github and work on them. It makes me very happy when my projects are being worked on, but I don't have enough time to do so on my own on most projects.
</p><p>
Secondly, you can check out and maybe use my products and software, this also makes me happy. It shows me that what I'm doing isn't totally useless.
</p><p>
Thirdly, you can give me some feedback. Whether positive or negative, I always enjoy reading good feedback, that means, if you give me a feedback, please elaborate on the subject and explain me why I did something good/bad and how I could do better.
</p><p>
Lastly, you can donate money to me. With this money I can fund new and existing projects.

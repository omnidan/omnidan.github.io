I love structure, especially when it's simple. Everything that
interests me has a lot to do with structure - which is mainly Business,
Programming and Development, but I also love making music and enjoy nature a lot
(going for a walk, riding my bike, or just sketching ideas in my notebook outside)

I spend most of my time reading articles, checking out cool and new stuff on the
web and [working on awesome projects](/projects/).
I [write](/articles/) and make music sometimes (the latter is more experimenting
with synthesizers and sounds than making full tracks).
I also love certain computer games, [dwarf fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress)
is one of my favorites. (Programmers and dwarves have *a lot* in common)

I am currently studying [Business Informatics](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/teaching/bachelor_programs/business_informatics/)
at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/) (Technical University of Vienna) and I'm
a technical tutor for the [Programmkonstruktion (Program Construction ~= Programming) course](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?locale=en&courseNr=185A79).
My main job there is the development and maintenance of the Multiple-Choice Exam
Application.

Feel free to contact me about anything - services, ideas, your projects, my
projects, the list goes on and on - even if you just want to chat with me. Just
message me on any social network (list is on the bottom of this page) or shoot

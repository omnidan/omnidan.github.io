    I'm Daniel Bugl, but some might know me as omnidan, which is my most frequently used nickname, or Daniel0108, which is my old and obsolete nickname.
    </p><p>
    I currently work full-time as a student and part-time as an architect for technical structures and software engineer at TouchLay. Well, it's pretty much choose-your-time-to-work-but-follow-deadlines-and-go-to-meetings.

<h2>Supporting me</h2>
<p>
First of all, you can fork my repositories on github and work on them. It makes me very happy when my projects are being worked on, but I don't have enough time to do so on my own on most projects.
</p><p>
Secondly, you can check out and maybe use my products and software, this also makes me happy. It shows me that what I'm doing isn't totally useless.
</p><p>
Thirdly, you can give me some feedback. Whether positive or negative, I always enjoy reading good feedback, that means, if you give me a feedback, please elaborate on the subject and explain me why I did something good/bad and how I could do better. 
</p><p>
Lastly, you can donate money to me. With this money I can fund new and existing projects.

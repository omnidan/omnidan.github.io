        <h3 class="skills-header">Software Engineering</h3>
        <p class="skills-content">I specialised in the design and architecture of programs, especially APIs. I developed the TouchLay Cloud API and the backend for the Aurora operating system. Besides development and design, I also do software packaging.
          <br>Game programming is how I got into the world of programming when I was still a child. I coded quite a few rendering engines and learned a lot about OpenGL and SDL. Even though I liked it, this is pretty much the past. I specialised myself in
          the architecture of programs instead of the graphical output.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skills">
        <h3 class="skills-header">Configuration</h3>
        <p class="skills-content">I love to configure machines, which is why I like open source systems so much. I am very experienced with Debian, which I use as my main operating system, and Ubuntu. I am also quite familiar with computer security.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skills">
        <h3 class="skills-header">Microcontrollers</h3>
        <p class="skills-content">In my leisure time I enjoy working with microcontrollers and electrical circuits in general. I use atmel chips most frequently, which is why I know AVR-Assembler best, but I also know PIC- (for PIC chips) and GAS- (for GNU/Linux) Assembler. Additionally,
          I can program in NASM/MASM too, but my assembler skills might be a bit rusty now, because I usually write my chips in C/C++ and the Arduino framework. To simplify Arduino development for other chips than the official Arduino ones, I created
          ArduinoPure, which is a set of Makefiles that compile and flash code using the Arduino framework.</p>

        <h3 class="skills-header">Ubuntu and Debian</h3>
        <p class="skills-content">In the past, I've been doing a lot for the Ubuntu community. I used to be a member and mentor in many of the Ubuntu teams.That changed around the time when they moved to Unity, but this wasn't even the reason for my resignation. I just got quite
          busy with studying and my startup, so I decided to quit it. I still have an askubuntu account, which I sometimes check and I am still a moderator on ubuntuforums. When I was still active, I used to be a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team (those
          who help beginners), a council member of Ubuntu Youth, the leader and re-founder of the Ubuntu Austria LoCo (Local Community) and a mentor in the community. Now I'm only using Debian, which I used before I tried Ubuntu for a few versions (10.04-11.10,
          if I remember correctly). I don't really have plans on going back to Ubuntu, because of the decisions they make with Unity, but getting a bit more active in the community again would be joyful.
          <br>I'm still a bit active in the Debian community now. I frequently check the mailing lists and from time to time I visit the Debienna in Vienna.</p>

      <div class="skills">
        <h3 class="skills-header">Arduino</h3>
        <p class="skills-content">As previously stated, I work a lot with atmel microcontrollers, which are used in Arduino products. I possess an Arduino UNO with an Ethernet shield and use it to prototype some of my chips. I've also created ArduinoPure, which is a framework
          based off the Arduino framework. The difference is, it doesn't need the Arduino IDE or any GUI running (I know Arduino released a Makefile, but that's old and only works on older versions of the Arduino framework). You can program with the Arduino
          framework just like you're used to now! Use "make" to compile the program and "make upload" to upload it to the microcontroller. Of course, you have to change some settings in the Makefile first (set your microcontroller, programmer, etc...).
          ArduinoPure also solved another problem I had with Arduino. It wouldn't upload correctly with my stk500. I think that's because Arduino is based off the stk500 protocol, so it assumes it's the Arduino-version of the stk500 protocol, but it actually
          is the real stk500. I've always had to compile in the IDE, take the temporary hex file and upload it manually via "avrdude". That was quite annoying. ArduinoPure solved all that for me, which is why I started it. It's still actively maintained,
          also, feel free to fork and help me working on it.</p>
